GreenSync ‚Äî AI-Powered Gardening Ecosystem with Robotic Integration
GreenSync is an advanced AI-driven gardening platform that fuses computer vision, a fine-tuned LLM, and real-time robotics to deliver intelligent plant care, disease diagnosis, and emotional plant-state interpretation. It‚Äôs designed to understand, diagnose, and nurture plants ‚Äî autonomously.
Overview
GreenSync brings together multiple AI subsystems into a single, efficient ecosystem:
WaraqƒÅ æ ‚Äî The Robotic Gardener
A physical robot powered by GreenSync‚Äôs intelligence, capable of real-time plant care, navigation, and task execution using SLAM and multi-modal sensory feedback.
Plant Doctor (Wariq CNN)
A 200B-parameter convolutional neural network that identifies plant diseases with 99.6% validation accuracy.
Ask AI (Wariq CNN)
A 200B-parameter CNN fine-tuned for general plant queries and semantic understanding of visual data.
WaraqaGPT (LLM)
A custom fine-tuned large language model trained on 200B handcrafted Q&A pairs and 82 curated botany books. It acts as GreenSync‚Äôs core reasoning engine for contextual dialogue, care recommendations, and ‚ÄúPlant Autopsy‚Äù reports.
GreenBrain Integration
A central orchestrator that synchronizes sensory data, LLM inference, CNN outputs, and robotic control to maintain a latency of ~200ms ‚Äî ensuring seamless AI-hardware communication.
Core Features
1. Plant Disease Detection
Uses Plant Doctor (Wariq) CNN for visual diagnosis.
Classifies diseases and suggests treatments based on symptom correlation.
Trained exclusively on a handcrafted dataset of real-world samples.
2. Semantic Plant Autopsy
Analyzes plant history (care logs, environment, images).
Generates a causal graph explaining plant health decline or death.
Produces an emotionally grounded narrative (health timeline + cause analysis).
3. Intelligent Conversation via WaraqaGPT
Contextual Q&A based on user logs and plant data.
Can express emotional tone (e.g., empathy for dying plants üåøüíî).
Uses advanced reasoning, not reprompt-based pseudo-logic.
4. Robotic Navigation and Action
SLAM-based autonomous navigation for watering, pruning, and inspection.
Real-time communication with the AI core at 200ms latency.
Custom hardware layout and placement designed for minimal signal delay.
5. GreenSync Web & App Interface
Built using Flask + Bootstrap.
Supports live monitoring, visual plant reports, and voice-first interaction.
Integrates directly with WaraqƒÅ æ through a unified dashboard.
